# habitman

Inspired by https://swarmsim.github.io/#/, The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg, and a poor lifestyle.

This will be an upgrade to a previous Habit Man, found here: http://quitlol.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/HabitMan2.html

Habit Man is an idle game designed help the user improve daily habits. The user works a job and manages his "Habit Bars" by investing "Habit Power". He earns "Habit Power" by clicking on the "Training" button. During training, the user is shown a series of symptoms of a poor lifestyle, each of which can be quickly solved by choosing the appropriate health tip.

This game will be an effective tool to condition users to build better daily habits:

1. The user will associate specific external cues with an appropriate remedy.

2. In life, we can't learn lifestyle habits quickly because the process is slow. This game allows for quick repetition to facilitate this process.

3. Using "upgrades" in this idle game will keep the user interested, along with interesting game content.
