                    <h3>He decided to make a game to <i>get those habits engrained onto the grooves of his brain!</i></h3>

                    <h3>I put this game online to help people (like it helped me) learn awesome healthy habits!</h3>
                    <h3>Who knows, you could use this game, and end up making $10 million!!</h3>
